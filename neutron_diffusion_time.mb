The Question
===========
Once neutrons reach the water in the Neutron Multiplicity Meter, the timescale for their capture is about 10 microseconds.  But how long does it take the neutron - born in the lead bricks beneath - to get to the water in the first place?


The Path
=======
If the motion of the neutron was similar to Brownian Motion (free travel punctuated by random changes in direction on a characteristic time scale), then we'd have a way forward.  Lucky for us, our neutron's movement is well described by Brownian motion: its energy changes very little because lead nuclei are so much heavier, and at these energies scattering is isotropic [citation needed].

So.  We can think of the neutron as flying freely between lead nuclei- but only for so long.  After some characteristic distance, the neutron will smack into a lead nucleus and emerge in a random direction to continue its journey.

The reason the neutron makes progress towards the water tank isn't because it was originally headed in that direction.  It's because the width of its position distribution increases, thus increasing its likelihood of being found further from its starting point.

If we assume that the width of the neutron's probability distribution obeys Poisson statistics, then $\sigma = \sqrt{N_{bounces}}$.

If we want to find the typical time for a neutron to wander some distance $L$ from its origin, we need to find the time such that
$$L = \sqrt{N_{bounces}} \lambda_{Pb},$$
where $\lambda_{Pb}$ is the neutron's average path length between collisions.

This leaves us with two questions to answer for a solution.
1. What's the relationship between lab time and how many times the neutron has bounced?
2. How can we express the neutron's characteristic path length in lead using known quantities?

What is $\lambda_{Pb}$?

And so.  A solution.
